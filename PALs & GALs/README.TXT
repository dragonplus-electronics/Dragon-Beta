This ZIP contains the original EQN files which were produced from dumping the contents of the original PALs. Also contained are the JED files to program PALs, as well as JED files to program GALs.

You can convert between EQN, JED (PAL) and JED (GAL) using an MSDOS program called OpalJR. There are other ways to do this though.
